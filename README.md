## :seedling: Overview
**License Notice:**<br>
  Everdale is  source-availabe. The source code is publicly visible for learning and personal use, but redistribution of modified versions is not permitted. See [LICENSE](./LICENSE.md) for details.
  
**Everdale** is a calm, immersive farmind and life-simulation mod designed as an **escape**, a place to slow down, nurture plants and animals, discover cultures and ingredients and lose yourself in a living, breathing world.<br>
Rather than focusing on efficiency or automation-first gameplay, Everdale emphasizes **care, discovery and tranquility**. Crops grow naturally, animals respond to gentle attention, cooking rewards creativity and exploration uncovers new fruits, recipes and traditions.<br>
Everdale is meant to feel complete on its own, a self-contained experience you can return to when you want peace, focus and a sense fo quiet progression.

## :sparkles: Core Features
### :ear:of_rice: Crops & Gardening
+ Multi-stage, visually rich crop growth
+ Soil quality, water, biome and environment influence plants
+ Overhauled vanilla crops for a cohesive, immersive experience
+ New crops, fruits and wild plants discovered through exploration

### :cow2: Animals & Livestock
+ Gentle animal care - feeding, breeding and companionship
+ Natural behavior and feedback
+ Animal products integrated with cooking and crafting

### :curry: Cooking & Kitchen Life
+ Flexible, ingredient-driven recipe system
+ Encourages experimentation rather than rigid recipes
+ Encourages kitchen tools (stoves, peparation blocks, containers, etc.)
+ Meals focus on variety, culture and enjoyment, not min-maxing

### :farmer: NPCs & Trade
+ Traders and villagers offer regional crops, ingredients and recipes
+ Cultural identity reflected through food and agriculture
+ Progression through relationships and discovery, not grinding

### :world_map: Exploration & Discovery
+ Biome- and region-specific plants and ingredients
+ Rare seeds, forgotten recipes and hidden locations

### :balance_scale: Gentle Realism
+ Crops require care, but are forgiving
+ Animals thrive through attention and neglect has its downsides
+ Weather and environment subtly influence growth
+ Realism exists to deepen immersion, never to add stress

## :herb: Design Philosophy
+ **Immersion first** - every system feels part of the same living world
+ **Peaceful gameplay** - no harsh penalties, no pressure
+ **Self-contained** - Everdale is a complete farming experience
+ **Discovery-driven** - curiosity is always rewarded
+ **Coexistence, not dependency** - compatible with quality-of-ife mods, but never reliant on them

Everdale is not designed to "complete" other farming mods, it is meant to **be the star**.

## :electric_plug: Comatibility
+ Fully compatible with:
    + JEI / recipe viewers
    + World-generation mods (e.g. Biomes O'Plenty)
    + Visual and quality-of-life mods
+ Other farming mods may coexist, but Everdale does **not** integrate or depend on them mechanically.
