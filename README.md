## :seedling: Overview
**License Notice:**  
Everdale is source-available. The source code is publicly visible for learning and personal use, but redistribution of modified versions is not permitted. See [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md) for full details.

**Everdale** is a calm, immersive farming and life-simulation mod designed as an **escape** — a place to slow down, nurture plants and animals, discover regional ingredients and recipes, and lose yourself in a thoughtful, unhurried world. Rather than focusing on efficiency or automation-first gameplay, Everdale emphasizes **care, discovery, and tranquility**. Crops grow naturally over time, animals respond to gentle attention, and cooking rewards experimentation and creativity. Everdale is meant to feel complete on its own: a self-contained experience you can return to when you want peace, focus, and a sense of quiet progression.

<a id="design-philosophy"></a>
## :herb: Design Philosophy
+ **Immersion first** — every system feels part of the same living world
+ **Peaceful gameplay** — no harsh penalties or artificial pressure
+ **Self-contained** — Everdale is a complete farming experience
+ **Discovery-driven** — curiosity is consistently rewarded
+ **Coexistence, not dependency** — compatible with quality-of-life mods but never reliant on them

Everdale is not designed to "complete" other farming mods; it is meant to **be the star**.

<a id="compatibility"></a>
## :electric_plug: Compatibility
+ Fully compatible with:
  + JEI / recipe viewers
  + World-generation mods (e.g. Biomes O'Plenty)
  + Visual and quality-of-life mods
+ Other farming mods may coexist, but Everdale does **not** integrate or depend on them mechanically.

<a id="installation"></a>
## :package: Installation

2. Place the Everdale.jar file into your mods folder
3. (Optional) Install JEI for recipe browsing

<a id="configuration"></a>
