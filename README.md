## :herb: Design Philosophy
+ **Immersion first** - every system feels part of the same living world
+ **Peaceful gameplay** - no harsh penalties, no pressure
+ **Self-contained** - Everdale is a complete farming experience
+ **Discovery-driven** - curiosity is always rewarded
+ **Coexistence, not dependency** - compatible with quality-of-ife mods, but never reliant on them

Everdale is not designed to "complete" other farming mods, it is meant to **be the star**.

+ Fully compatible with:
    + JEI / recipe viewers
    + World-generation mods (e.g. Biomes O'Plenty)
    + Visual and quality-of-life mods
+ Other farming mods may coexist, but Everdale does **not** integrate or depend on them mechanically.
