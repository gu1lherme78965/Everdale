# :herb: Everdale - A Retreat in a Living World
Everdale is a Minecraft mod born from a desire to create **peacefull, immersive and fully self-contained farming experience**. Its core purpose is to provide players with a world where they can 
**slow down, explore and care**, free from the pressure and stress of efficiency-driven gameplay. This is not a mod about speed, automation or competition, it is a mod about **presence, curiosity and tranquility**.

The vision for Everdale is guided by one central idea: **a living world that responds to attention, care and curiosity**, allowing the player to settle into its rhytms when they wish, or explore freely if they choose.
Both approaches are valid, and both are richly supported: players may immerse themselves in quiet daily routines, tending to crops and livestock, or venture into discovery and experimentation.
Everdale deos not push one path over another, instead it offers **a world full of meaningful choices and gentle consequences**.

## :earth_africa: A World Reimagined
To achieve this immersive feeling, Everdale **significantly overhauls vanilla Minecraft systems**. Crops grow with visual and mehanical depth, reflecting soil quality, environment and care. Animals display natural
behaviors that reward attention and create a sense of life. Even familiar blocks and items are reimagined to fit the coherent aesthetic and internal logic of the world.

This overhaul is not cosmetic; it is **foundational**. It allows every interaction - planting, harvesting, cooking or trading - to feel purposeful and satisfying. Vanilla Minecraft is recognizable, but players will quickly
realize that Everdale is **a world of its own**, designed to feel alive, believable and internally consistent.

## :video_game: Immersive Gameplay, Not Mechanics
While systems exist to create depth and engagement, the focus of Everdale is always on **exeperience over optimization**. Cooking, gardening, animal care, exploration and trading are designed to **reward curiosity and engagement**,
not mastery or efficiency, Players are encouraged to interact with the world at their own pace, and every small actioncontributes to a sense of presence and satisfaction.

The mod aims to invoke the feeling of:
- **Comfort** - settling into daily routines and seeing the world respond to care
- **Curiosity** - discovering new crops, ingredients and NPC behaviors
- **Connection** - undestanding the rhythms of the world and the interdependence of its elements

Everdale does not prescribe how the olayer should feel, but it **provides the tools and environment for these to emerge naturally**.

## :star: A Self-Contained Experience
Everdale is intended as a **complete, standalone farming experience**. It is not a supplementary mod designed to integrate into ohter farming systems. Every feature, from crop growth to cooking, from animals to NPC trade, has been
crafted to work together in harmony. While compatible with quality-of-life mods, Everdale is **the sta of its own world**: everything the player needs to enjoy a rich, peaceful and immersive farming life is included.

This self-contained design ensures that players do not feel compelled to mix systems from other mods to achieve a satisfying experience. Every element is deliberate, every system coherent and every interaction meaningful.

## :sparkles: The Feel We Strive For
Above all, Everdale is about **how it feels to inhabit the world**. It is a place where the player can slow down, step away from the pressures of the outside world and find **peace in care, exploration and quiet achievement**.
It is a world where players can nurture crops and animals, experiment in the kitchen, trade with thoughtful NPCs and slowly uncover the richness of the environment.

The mod's systems are designed to support **emotional resonance**, not mechanical optimization. It is an invitation to:
- Pause
- Observe
- Discover
- Apreciate the small moments that emerge naturally from the world

Everdale is, at its heart, a **retreat**:a place to slow down, to breathe and to feel a sense of calm agency in a living, reponsive world.

## :notebook: Conclusion
Everdale is **more than a collection of mechanics**; it is an authored world. Every crop, animal, recipe and interaction exists to support **immersion, tranquility and engagement**. It is designed to stand on its own,
to welcome players seeking a quiet, rich and rewarding experience, and to provide them with a world that feels **alive, coherent and motionally fulfilling**.

In Everdale, the player is not just building, harvesting or cooking, thay are inhabiting a **world that cares back**.
