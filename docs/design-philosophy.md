# :herb: Everdale - Design Philosophy
Everdale is a world built around **immersion, tranquility and meaningful interaction**. Every design decision is guided by the principle that the mod must feel **alive, coherent and self-contained**.

This document outlines the **core philosophies and rules** that govern all systems, mechanics and  content in Everdale. It is intended to guide both development and future design decisions, ensuring the project
stays true to its vision.

## 1. Player Experience First
- The player's **emotional journey** takes priority over mechanics or optimization.
- Interactions should feel **rewarding and intuitive***, not stressful or punishing.
- The mod must allow players to **engage at their own pace**, wether they want to settle into routine or explore freely.

## 2. Immersion Over Efficiency
- Systems should reinforce **world coherence and realism** without adding frustration.
- Automation is optional and limited; player engagement is always meaningful.
- Visual and mechanical feedback must clearly communicate the **state of crops, animals and resources**.
- Vanilla systems tat are overhauled (crops, animals, blocks) must **feel natural** and integrated, not tacked-on.

## 3. Discovery and Exploration
- Curiosity should be consistently rewarded.
- Crops, recipes, ingredients and NPC interactions should encourage **experimentation and observation**.
- Hidden elements (rare seeds, unique recipes, small environmental details) add **depth without enforcing grind**.
- Exploration should feel **organic**, with new content revealed naturally rather than through strict progression gates.

## 4. Self-Contained, Cohesive Systems
- Everdale is **the complete famring experience**: all gameplay loops exist within the mod.
- While compatible with some quality-of-life mods (e.g. JEI) it **does not require nor integrate other farming mods**.
- Every mechanic, from growth systems to cooking, should **support other systems**, creating a coherent, interdependent world.
- Out-of-mod dependencies should be avoided unless they enhance immersion without compromising the core experience.

## 5. Gentle Realism
- Realism should **enhance engagement** but never punish the player harshly.
- Crops, animals and environmental systems have **intuitive rules** that are understandable without a manual.
- Naturral consequences exist (e.g. crops require water, animals need attention), but **failure is instructive not frustrating**.
- Subtle environmental infuences (weather, soil, biome) exist to **enrich immersion**, not to complicate gameplay unnecessarily.

## 6. Meaningful Progression
- Progression is **organic and player-driven**, not dictated by time or external pressure.
- Unlocks (crops, recipes, NPC interactions) rewards **curiosity and exploration**, not grinding.
- Players are free to focus on whichever aspects of the world they find  most rewarding; farming, cooking, animal care or exploration.

## 7.Consistency and Coherence
- Every system, mechanic and visual element should **fit the world's internal logic**.
- Names, visuals and interactions ust be **clear and intuitive**.
- Overhauls of vanilla content must **feel like natural extensions** of the base game rather than arbitrary replacements.

## 8. Tranquility and Calm
- Avoid features that create stress, urgency or excessive micromanagement if they are unavoidable.
- Feedback should be **informative and gentle**, never alarming.
- The world should **invite players to pause, observe and interact meaningfully**, reinforcing the mod's central goal: a peaceful, immersive retreat.

## 9. Scope Discipline
- Only features aligned with the **core vision** are implemented.
- Feature creep is actively avoided - "nice-to-haves" are logged but deffered until they **enhance immersion without compromising tranquility**.
- New ideas are evaluated against the **Everdale lens**: do they support the world's feel, not just mechanical complexity?

## :pencil: Conclusion
The **Design Philosophy** ensures that every decision in Everdale supports the **vision of a self-contained, immersive and tranquil farming experience**. It serves as the **development compass**: any feature, adjustment
or mechanic that violates these principles is automatically a candiate for reevaluation or rejection.

Everdale is **more than a mod**; it is a carefully authored world where players are encouraged to slow down, explore adn connect with a living, responsive environment. The design philosophy ensures that this world remains
coherent, purposeful and true to its vision from the first code to final release.
