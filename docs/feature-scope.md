## :x: 2. Out of Scope Features
### A. Automation & Factory Systems

## :telescope: 3. Nice to Have / Future Features
*(These are optional post-1.0 enhancements to enrich immersion.)*
- Seasonal festivals or NPC events.
- Additional rare crops, ingredients or recipes for late-game content.
- Minor environmental storytelling elements (ruins, abandoned farms).

## :pencil: Conclusion
This scope document ensures that Everdale remains **focused, cohesive and  faithful to its vision**. Every feature must **serve the player experience, support immersion and respect the 
tranquil pace** of the world.

Any feature outside this scope is a candidate for deferment or exclusion, protecting the identity and design integrity of Everdale.
