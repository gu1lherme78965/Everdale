# :herb: Everdale - Development Roadmap
This roadmap outlines the **high-level development phases** of Everdale. It is intended as a **guiding structure**, not a strict schedule. Dates are intentionally omitted to preserve flexibility and avoid
unnecessary pressure.

Each phase builds upon the previous one, with the goal of delivering a **cohesive, immersive and self-contained farming experience** by version **1.0**.

## :pencil2: Phase 0 - Foundation & Direction (Pre-Code)
**Goal**: Lock vision, scope and design principles before implementation.
- Define Everdale's vision, philosophy and feature boundaries.
- Establish documentation structure and project conventions
- Decide architectural direction and mod loader target
- Set expectations for compatibility and self-contained design.

>This phase ensures that all future development decisions remain aligned with the original intent of Everdale.

## :timer_clock: Phase 1 - Core Systems Foundation
**Goal**: Implement the fundamental systems that define Everdale's identity.

### Core Gameplay Systems
- Overhauled crop growth system (multi-stage, care-based, visually clear)
- Soil, environment and growth conditions framework
- Basic animal behavior and care foundations
- Core cooking and ingredient handling systems

### Technical Foundation
- Data-driven system design where possible
- Clean separation between gameplay logic and content
- Configuration system for realism and compatibility options

> At the end fo this phase, Everdale should already feel distinct from vanilla Minecraft, even with limited content.

## :timer_clock: Phase 2 - Depth & Interconnection
**Goal**: Expand systems and ensure they interact meaningfully.

### Agriculture & Cooking
- Expanded crop and ingredient variety
- Deeper cooking interactions and recipe flexibility
- Balanced yields and feedback loops between farming and food

### Animals & World Interaction
- Expanded animal behaviors and interactions
- Clear visual and mechanical feedback for care and neglect
- Integration between animals, farming and cooking systems

### NPCs & Trade
- Initial NPC trade systems
- Region- or biome-influenced trade offerings
- Light progression through discovery and interaction, not grinding

>This phase focuses on **depth**, ensuring systems reinforce one another rather than existing in isolation.

## :timer_clock: Phase 3 - Content Expansions & Breadth
**Goal**: Reach a satisfying level of content variety without introducing new core systems.
- Broader selection of crops, fruits and ingredients
- Expanded recipe catalog
- Additional animal variations or behaviors
- Exploration-driven discoveries (rare plants, ingredients)

> No new major systems are introduced in this phase. The focus is on **content richness**, not mechanical complexity.
